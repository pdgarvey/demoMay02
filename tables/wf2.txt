The ancient masters were profound and subtle
their wisdom was unfathomable

Safe in their alabaster chambers
untouched by morning untouched by noon
lie the members of the meek resurrection
rafter of satin roof of stone!

grand go the years in the crescent above them
soundless as dots on a disc of snow
